  *version 0.6.2* fix a bug in Gyro Reverse.

  Currently there is a new branch *HefnyCopter2* This is a new version compatible with the new *KKv2.0 board*. This branch is still under developing.

  *version 0.6.5* Complementary filter for Gyro are applied.
     also UI fix -suggested by a friend- when arming LED blinks based
on quadcopter mode either Plus or X.
       

==HefnyCopter2==

 This is designed for *KK2 board*.
 Now I finished most of stability software issues...a prerelease test can be found here on http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BknlTkF9ZOQ
 I am tuning some UI issues in the LCD and updating the manual in order to be able to product a proper release.
*06 Oct 2012:*
1- XBEE integration is finished and tested, also the Windows application that receives data.
2- Buddy mode has been implemented to allow concurrent two pilots to fly quadcopter, as a trainee and trainer. You can also use this feature for UAV test.
